    <p>After many years in IT leadership, business and the military, Joseph Djokey discovered that servant leadership can transform teams into high performance and greatness. He believes IT is a tool of liberation, so he set up Djokey.com to help individuals and organisations to align technology to the overall business objective. Joseph has mentored, advised and facilitated a number of IT projects, including leading the IT team for Rev Jesse Jackson’s “Equanomics” UK tour.

Whilst in military service, Joseph led a self-organising and cross-functional team tasked to manage both the private and public website of his regiment, a unit that combines the speed and agility of airborne and air assault troops.

A skilled and adaptable leader with experience in implementing and facilitating change, Joseph Djokey now coaches organisations in Agile delivery. As a Scrum Master Joseph enjoys being the servant leader of a global scrum team distributed in different time zones. </p>
